# scoop-epubcheck

A [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) bucket for 64-bit Windows providing self-contained packages for [EPUBCheck](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck) and [OpenReadest](https://github.com/luyishui/OpenReadest). 32-bit Windows is not supported.

## EPUBCheck

Every release bundles everything needed to run EPUBCheck — no system Java, no configuration:

- `epubcheck.cmd` — launcher (shim-friendly)
- `epubcheck.jar` + `lib/` — EPUBCheck itself
- `jre/` — private Eclipse Temurin JRE (Windows x64 only)
- `licenses/`, `LICENSE.txt`, `THIRD-PARTY.txt` — upstream license files

## OpenReadest

[OpenReadest](https://github.com/luyishui/OpenReadest) is an unofficial [Readest](https://github.com/readest/readest) fork focused on local reading with WebDAV sync (Tauri/WebView2 GUI app, AGPL-3.0).

The bucket ships a **portable build repackaged from the official Windows installer** (7-Zip extraction in CI):

- `openreadest.exe` — the app itself
- `openreadest_thumbnail.dll` — Explorer thumbnail provider library (not registered by the portable package)
- `LICENSE.txt`, `NOTICE.md` — upstream license and notices

Unlike the stock installer, the portable package runs without UAC and makes **no registry changes and no file associations** (no epub/pdf association takeover, no thumbnail handler registration, no `openreadest://` deep link). App data lives in `%APPDATA%\com.openreadest.app`, outside of Scoop's directory. The app requires the Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime (preinstalled on Windows 11 and up-to-date Windows 10).

## Install

```powershell
scoop bucket add scoop-epubcheck https://github.com/linkcccp/scoop-epubcheck
scoop install epubcheck
scoop install openreadest
```

## Usage

```powershell
epubcheck my-book.epub
epubcheck --version
```

OpenReadest is a GUI app — start it from the Start Menu shortcut, through the `openreadest` shim, or pass files to open:

```powershell
openreadest my-book.epub
```

## How updates work

A scheduled GitHub Action runs daily per app:

1. [update-epubcheck.yml](.github/workflows/update-epubcheck.yml) detects the latest upstream EPUBCheck release and the latest Temurin 21 JRE, downloads both, verifies checksums, assembles and smoke-tests a bundled release archive, publishes a release tagged `v<epubcheck>-jre<jre>` (e.g. `v5.4.0-jre21.0.12.1`) and updates [bucket/epubcheck.json](bucket/epubcheck.json).
2. [update-openreadest.yml](.github/workflows/update-openreadest.yml) detects the latest upstream OpenReadest release, verifies the installer against the upstream digest, extracts it with 7-Zip into a portable package (static smoke test, license files included), publishes a release tagged `openreadest-v<version>` (e.g. `openreadest-v0.9.100`) and updates [bucket/openreadest.json](bucket/openreadest.json).

OpenReadest releases are published with `--latest=false` so the EPUBCheck release keeps the repository's *latest* badge.

The manifests can also be refreshed manually with `scoop update` / `scoop status` after a release is published.

## Development

- `bin\checkver.ps1 epubcheck` — compare the epubcheck manifest version with published releases (add `-Update` to rewrite it)
- `bin\checkver.ps1 openreadest` — same for the openreadest manifest
- `bin\test.ps1` — run the official Scoop bucket test suite: manifest schema validation plus repository style checks (requires PowerShell Pester ≥ 5.2 and BuildHelpers)
